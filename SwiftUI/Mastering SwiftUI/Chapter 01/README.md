# Introduction to SwiftUI

This chapter discusses the new SwiftUI framework introduced at WWDC 2019, which represents a significant shift in the Apple developer ecosystem. SwiftUI enables the creation of user interfaces for all Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) using a declarative Swift syntax, making development simpler and faster.

The chapter highlights the main advantages of SwiftUI over traditional UI development methods, such as Storyboards and Auto Layout. SwiftUI allows you to visually design the interface and receive immediate feedback thanks to the preview feature in Xcode. It also covers the differences between declarative and imperative programming and how these differences impact UI coding.

Additionally, it discusses how SwiftUI integrates with existing frameworks like UIKit and AppKit, allowing its use in existing projects. The chapter concludes by addressing SwiftUI's maturity and future, recommending starting with personal or side projects to become familiar with the framework.#
