"A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.",negative
"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.",negative
"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.",negative
"Very little music or anything to speak of.",negative
"The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.",positive
"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.",negative

"I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.",positive

"This game rocks.",positive
"Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.",positive
"It's PURE BRILLIANCE.",positive
"This was a flick doomed from its conception.",negative
"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.",negative
"I wasn't the least bit interested.",negative
"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.",negative

"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.",negative
"The story itself is just predictable and lazy.",negative
"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.",negative

"There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.",negative
"There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.",negative
"This movie totally grates on my nerves.",negative
"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.",negative
"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.",negative
"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.",negative
"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.",negative
"There are some generally great things in it.",positive
"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.",negative
"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.",positive

"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.",negative
"An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.",negative
"But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.",positive
"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.",positive
"The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.",negative
"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!",negative
"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.",negative
"The directing seems too pretentious.",negative
"The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.",negative
"And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.",negative
"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.",negative
"Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.",positive
"I really liked that.",positive

"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.",negative

"There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.",negative
"This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".",negative

"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.",negative
"I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.",negative
"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.",negative
"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.",negative
"All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.",negative
"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.",negative
"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.",negative
"This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.",positive
"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.",negative

"NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).",negative
"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.",negative
"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.",negative

"Highly unrecommended.",negative
"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.",negative
"Yes, it's that bad.",negative
"Nothing at all to recommend.",negative
"An excellent performance from Ms.",positive
"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.",positive
"It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.",positive
"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.",negative
"There were too many close ups.",negative
"But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.",negative

"I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.",negative
"I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.",negative
"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.",negative
"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.",negative
"Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.",positive
"His performance is simply genius.",positive
"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.",positive
"In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.",positive
"Ray Charles is legendary.",positive
"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.",positive
"Hitchcock is a great director.",positive
"Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.",negative
"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.",positive
"It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.",negative
"Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.",negative
"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.",negative
"There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.",negative
"Mishima is extremely uninteresting.",negative
"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.",negative
"The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.",negative
"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.",negative
"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.",negative
"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.",negative
"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.",positive
"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.",positive

"The character developments also lacked in depth.",negative
"Woa, talk about awful.",negative
"Do not waste your time.",negative
"It was just too horrible.",negative
"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.",negative
"But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.",negative
"The poor actors.",negative
"You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.",negative
"If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.",negative
"This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.",negative
"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.",positive
"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.",positive
"Regrettably, the film fails.",negative
"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.",negative

"I came out of it feeling angry.",negative
"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.",positive
"The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.",positive
"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).",positive
"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.",positive
"All things considered, a job very well done.",positive
"Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.",positive
"One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.",positive
"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.",positive

"Up there with the best of Melville.",positive
"Everything about this film is simply incredible.",positive
"You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.",positive
"BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.",positive
"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.",positive
"I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.",positive
"I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.",negative
"If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.",negative
"There is a lot of beautiful places.",positive
"It was forced, like everything in this movie.",negative

"When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.",negative
"Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.",negative
"The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.",negative
"The acting was bad.",negative
"Really bad.",negative
"Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.",negative
"Camerawork - again, bad.",negative
"Rating: 1 out of 10.",negative
"An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!",positive
"Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.",positive
"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.",positive
"His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.",positive
"Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.",positive
"And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.",positive
"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.",positive

"All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.",positive
"I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.",negative
"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".",negative
"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .",negative
"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.",negative
"This is such a fun and funny movie.",positive
"Highly entertaining at all angles.",positive
"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.",positive

"By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.",negative
"Glad I didn't pay to see it.",negative
"Didn't laugh or even smile once.",negative

"Barney is definitely super DE duper.",positive
"is pretty funny.",positive

"I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.",negative
"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.",negative
"The jerky camera movements were also annoying.",negative
"The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.",negative
"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.",negative

"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.",negative
"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.",positive

"I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.",positive
"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.",positive
") What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.",positive
"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".",positive
"This is high adventure at its best.",positive
"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.",positive

"This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.",positive

"Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.",negative
"I wish I could enter negative values, admins?",negative
"The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.",negative
"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.",negative
"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.",negative
"I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.",negative

"It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.",negative
"1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.",negative

"The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.",positive
"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.",negative
"Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.",positive
"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.",negative
"Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.",positive
"But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.",negative
"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.",negative
"The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.",positive
"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.",negative
"The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.",negative
"I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.",positive
"I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.",positive
"My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.",positive

"This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.",negative
"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.",negative
"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.",negative
"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.",negative
"But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.",negative
"The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.",negative
"The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.",negative
"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.",negative
"I was deeply impressed with the character he played.",positive
"I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.",positive

"The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.",negative
"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.",negative
"The directing is sloppy at best.",negative
"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.",negative
"Of course, the acting is blah.",negative

"This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.",positive
"This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.",positive
"Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.",positive
"Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.",positive
"I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.",negative
"It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.",negative
"Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.",positive
"This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.",positive
"But this movie really got to me.",positive
"See it.",positive
"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.",positive

"About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.",negative
"About half way through this film I started to dislike it.",negative
"By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.",negative
"What this film lacks is a convincing script.",negative
"The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.",negative
"Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.",negative

"20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.",negative

"From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!",negative
"His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.",negative

"there is no real plot.",negative
"i wouldnt see this movie again for free.",negative
"STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.",positive
"This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.",positive
"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.",positive
"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.",positive
"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.",positive
"Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.",positive
"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.",negative
"I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.",negative
"The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.",positive
"John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.",positive

"I thought it was bad.",negative
"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.",negative
"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.",negative
"The script is a big flawed mess.",negative
"The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.",negative
"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim, clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.",negative
"The movie is terribly boring in places.",negative

"To sum the film up, Breeders is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.",negative
"Not recommended.",negative
"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.",negative
"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.",negative
"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.",negative
"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.",negative
"The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).",positive
"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.",negative
"The budget was evidently very limited.",negative
"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.",negative
"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.",negative
"Filmiing was less expansive.",negative
"It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.",negative
"Generally; it just lacked imagination.",negative
"Not recommended.",negative
"Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?",negative
"There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.",negative

"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!",negative
"I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!",negative
"Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!",negative
"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.",positive
"But Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.",positive
"The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.",positive

"Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.",positive
"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.",negative
"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.",negative
"Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.",positive
"There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.",negative
"I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.",negative
"What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?",negative
"To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.",negative
"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.",negative
"The story line is just awful!",negative

"Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.",negative

"VERY funny!",positive
"My rating: just 3 out of 10.",negative
"The characters are interesting and you really care for them.",positive
"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.",positive
"Don't miss it.",positive
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.",positive
"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).",positive
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.",positive
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.",positive
"The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.",negative
"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.",negative
"Avoid at all costs.",negative
"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!",positive
"I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!",positive

"But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.",positive
"I'll give this film 10 out of 10!",positive
"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.",negative
"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.",negative
"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.",positive
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.",positive
"Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.",positive
"I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!",positive
"Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !",positive
"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.",positive

"The cast is always entertaining as usual.",positive
"Overall, a delight!",positive
"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.",negative

"Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.",positive
"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.",positive
"Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10",positive
"Excellent performance.",positive
"There still are good actors around!",positive
"Also great directing and photography.",positive
"Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.",positive
"Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.",positive
"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.",positive
"If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.",positive
"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.",positive
"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.",positive
"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.",positive
"Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.",positive
"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.",negative
"Unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.",negative
"If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.",positive
"It is not good.",negative
"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.",negative
"Then the film just dropped the ball.",negative
"This is a stunning movie.",positive
"Raw and sublimely moving.",positive
"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.",positive
"All of the main players are mesmerising.",positive
"Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.",positive
"Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.",positive
"He's a national treasure.",positive
"GO AND SEE IT!",positive
"This is an excellent film.",positive
"The aerial scenes were well-done.",positive

"The film gives meaning to the phrase, Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.",positive
"Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.",positive
"A good film by a great director!",positive
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.",positive
"There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.",negative
"This is just a great movie.",positive

"The results, well, are a shame.",negative
"DELETE this film from your mind!",negative
"One of the worst shows of all time.",negative
